    <span>If you make a ruckus while inside, your family will be forced to walk you.  I like to howl whenever something passes by outside and follow my various family members around until they submit to my will. Also make sure you ram yourself onto the door and growl while gnawing on the leash to improve the effect.</span>

    Finally, make sure you get the best foods around by sitting under your family when they eat their meals, especially if they're in a rush.  Their crumbs taste delicious!  Also, some of my other favorite foods are broccoli and carrot sticks, which my brother slips me when he's eating.

    While on your walks, make sure you behave yourself. Unless you see something that moves faster than you, ie. joggers, bikers , cars.  Then bark as LOUD as you can and pull.  Also, whenever you get the opportunity, run away.  Just keep running until you get tired, then go back.  This method almost invariably gets you a treat because your family will be jubilated with your return.  Suckers.
