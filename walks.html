    If you make a ruckus while inside, your family will be forced to walk you.  I like to howl whenever something passes by outside and follow my various family members around until they submit to my will. Also make sure you ram yourself onto the door and growl while gnawing on the leash to improve the effect.

    Another essential thing to enjoying your walks is finding a location that suits you.  I love any beach that I can get near, as well as the Batavia Bark Park, where my family allows me to run free without a leash!  You can search for a nearby dog park online, most areas will have one nearby.
